First described in the 1930s by psychologist John Ridley Stroop, the Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty in naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color."
    
    static var history = """
The famous \"Stroop Effect\" is named after J. Ridley Stroop who discovered this strange phenomenon in the 1930s. Here is your job: name the colors of the following words. Do NOT read the words...rather, say the color of the words. For example, if the word \"BLUE\" is printed in a red color, you should say "RED". Say the colors as fast as you can. It is not as easy as you might think!
"""
    
   static var why =  "The words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the color. The interference between the different information your brain receives (what the words say and the color of the words) causes a problem. There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:"
    
    static var a = "Speed of Processing Theory:"
    
    static var b = "The interference occurs because words are read faster than colors are named."
    
    static var c = "Selective Attention Theory:"
    
    static var d = "The interference occurs because naming colors requires more attention than reading words."
